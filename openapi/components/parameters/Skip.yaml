  The number of posts to skip.

  The maximum value is the value of the `count` property returned by the operation subtracted by the number of posts to retrieve.

  For example, if the operation returns 10 posts and the `limit` query parameter is set to 5, the maximum value of the `skip` query parameter is 5.

  maxValue = count - limit
